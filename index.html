    <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>CSS stands for cascading style sheet.</li><br>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML, elements are to be displayed on screen,paper or in the media.</li><br>
        <li><span>CSS is not necessory</span> <mark>CSS saves lot of work</mark>. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.</li><br>
        <li id="olItem">External stylesheet are strored in CSS files.</li>
    </ol>
    <h1>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h1><br>
    <ul>
        <li>Inline- By using the style attribute inside HTML elements.</li>
        <li>Internal- By using a style element in the head section.</li>
        <li>External- By using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, <mark>in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles</mark>, because this is easier to demostrate and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
    </ul>
    <p id="paraOne">When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.</p>

    <p id="paraTwo">In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a webpage. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the elements.</p>
    
    <p id="paraThree">There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
